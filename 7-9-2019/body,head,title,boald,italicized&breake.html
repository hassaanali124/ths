            <p>
          After hearing how some qualified Indians are doing odd jobs in foreign countries,<br> 
            Ali started teaching students to develop primary and technical <br> communication skills.
             At the age of 11,<b><i>Mohammed Hassaan Ali </i></b> from Hyderabad is teaching engineering <br> students doing their Bachelor’s and Master’s.
              However,  <br>
             the Class VII student does not do this for profit: he refrains from taking fees for his services, <br> as he is deeply saddened by the 
             state of qualified engineers in foreign countries, <br> some of them having to settle for odd jobs to eke out a living.
