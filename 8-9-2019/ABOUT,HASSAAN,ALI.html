                <dt><b><i>story of hassaan ali:</i></b> </dt>
                <dd>After hearing how some qualified Indians are doing odd jobs in foreign countries,<br> 
                    Ali started teaching students to develop primary and technical <br> communication skills.
                     At the age of 11,<b><i> <abbr title="www.skillindialce.com">Mohammed Hassaan Ali</abbr>  </i></b> from Hyderabad is teaching engineering <br> 
                     students doing their Bachelor’s and Master’s.
                      However,  <br>
                     the Class VII student does not do this for profit: he refrains from taking fees for his services, <br> as he is deeply saddened by the 
                     state of qualified engineers in foreign countries, <br> some of them having to settle for odd jobs to eke out a living.</dd>
